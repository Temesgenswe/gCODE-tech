This Project is done by  only me (Temesgen Teshome). 
because, I ididn't have Internet for long time dueto civil war happening in my country Ethiopia. due to this reason most of the students were made thier groups before. 
This work was done to achieve the project portfolio blog of Alx Africa Foundation of Software Engineering in Africa. While doing this , I have faced some difficulties and I am very aware that I have learned a lot. I am happy to have completed this work after going through many difficulties.

Beyond the project, there is a training, software development and consulting facility called gCODE Technology. This was established in Debrebaran in 2016 E.C and from the very beginning we understood that it is a good opportunity for the community and especially for the children who are very technologically inclined, students from high school to university.
